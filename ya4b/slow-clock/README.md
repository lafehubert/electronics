This slow clock was initially inspired by Ben Eater's design (https://eater.net/8bit/clock) but I found the 555 to be too fiddly for the monostable stage, and overkill for the bistable stage, so I used a 74LS123 for the former and an R-S latch made from a couple of NANDs on a 74LS00 for the latter.  I also replaced the 74LS04 with a 74LS14 which seemed to clean up the waveform a good bit.
